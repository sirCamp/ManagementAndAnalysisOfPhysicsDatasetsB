    "\n",
    "#### How a worker is choosen?\n",
    "Even though you can reduce and make some restrictions, e.g: restriction over worker resources, Dask automatically decides the suitable workers for your tasks by figuring out the optimized worker for each task.\n",
    "This means that, if a task has significant data dependencies or if the workers are under heavy load then this choice of worker can strongly impact global performance because the decision becomes heavy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dask follows the following rules before to assign a task to a worker:\n",
    "+ If the task has no major dependencies and no restrictions then we find the least occupied worker.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ if a task has user-provided restrictions (for example it must run on a machine with a GPU) then we restrict the available pool of workers to just that set, otherwise, we consider all workers\n",
    "+ from the pool of workers Dask determinates the workers to whom the least amount of data would need to be transferred (means less overhead on the cluster and hence computation optimization).\n",
    "+  if some dependencies in the graph can be broken the will be assigned to the worker that currently has the fewest tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Dask also allows modifying the worker decision function in order to be more flexible and to improve the customization of a cluster. This means that particular processes or particular computational fields in which performances can be improved by customizing and optimizing the task's assignation decision can be made more performant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Breaking the dependencies in some cases is necessary, especially if each node has a lot of sons. In this case, each node with his sons must be removed from the graph and computed alone. This has a huge impact on performances and memory. On the other hand, this means that when a user submits a task, the computation graph must be scan to figuring out and optimizing this kind of dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How choose the next task?\n",
    "Typically Dask follows those rules in order to choose the next task that must be executed:\n",
    "+ Run tasks on a first-come-first-served basis for fairness between multiple clients\n",
    "+ Run tasks that are part of the critical path in an effort to reduce total running time and minimize straggler workloads\n",
    "+ Run tasks that allow us to release many dependencies in an effort to keep the memory footprint small\n",
    "+ Run tasks that are related so that large chunks of work can be completely eliminated before running new chunks of work\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see a part of the overhead on a cluster is principally caused by the optimization of the execution task decision. Even though these are rules implemented by Dask, in general, the majority of the Cluster, even if they are based on other frameworks and other architectures, follow the same similar approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, some computational fields may require a different approach to decide which tasks can be executed, e.g: by using last-in-first-out approach or by giving a priority to each task in order to execute first some processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases, Dask optimization exploit also a partially last-in-first-out approach. When a worker finishes a task the immediate dependencies of that task get top priority. This encourages a behavior of finishing ongoing work immediately before starting new work. This often conflicts with the first-come-first-served objective but often results in shorter total runtimes and significantly reduced memory footprints.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Where these decisions are made?\n",
    "\n",
    "The decision are basically made ina small steps and in a different computation steps by client, scheduler, and workers:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ As we submit a graph from the *client* to the scheduler we automatically assign a numeric priority to each task of that graph. This priority focuses on computing deeply before broadly, preferring critical paths, and preferring nodes with many dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ When the graph reaches the scheduler the scheduler changes each of these numeric priorities into a tuple of two numbers, the first of which is an increasing counter, the second of which is the client-generated priority described above. This per-graph counter encourages a first-in-first-out policy between computations. All tasks from a previous call to compute have a higher priority than all tasks from a subsequent call to compute (or submit, persist, map, or any operation that generates futures).\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Whenever a task is ready to run the scheduler assigns it to a worker. The scheduler does not wait based on priority. However when the worker receives these tasks it considers their priorities when determining which tasks to prioritize for communication or for computation. \n"
