    "Similar to the parallelization, the concept of the cluster is to execute multiple operations per time. Even thoguh these approaches are similar, in this case the instructions are executed in parallel over several CPUs that reside on the computers that compose the cluster instead of the single machine. \n",
    "The main idea, in fact, is to exploit the huge computation power of the cluster given by a larger number of CPUs and a larger amount of memory than a simple machine."

    "Dask is a powerful and simple instrument to create huge and scalable clusters and it allows to distribute the computation over the nodes that compose those clusters even with no strong knowledges on distributed calculos.\n",
    "\n",
    "A cluster is mainly composed by three types of machines:\n",
    "+ **Master machine**: master machine is the computer where the program is effectively running before to distrivuited the computation. In other terms, is the machine where you have to write your code and you have to work. Master machine communicato with Scheduler machine in order to submit the istructions to the cluster and in order to retrieve the results;\n",
    "+ **Scheduler machine**: The scheduler machine is responsible of scheduling the instructions and to distribute their over the machines that compose the cluster. In other terms, it decide how to schedule the processes.\n",
    "+ **Worker machine**: this type of machine is just an executor of instructions. A worker machine receive the instructions that it has to execute and then return the result to the scheduler.\n",
    "\n",
    "To give you a better idea in how a cluster works, think to the computation graph that we have seen in the previous notebook. In this case, the master machine create the graph that is submitted to the Scheduler machine that assing the execution of each node to a Worker machine.\n",

    "**Hint**\n",
    "When you work on a cluster you have to keep in mind that *normal programming* method is not a good solution. This because you have no guarantees on when the program will be executed. \n",
    "In fact, each time you submit an instruction to the cluster, the task is put in a **queue**. This Queue contains the list of all tasks/instructions that have been submitted to the cluster. \n",
    "When a worker machine has finished an instructuion and is turned free again, a task is taken from the queue and executed on the machine. This process continues until the queue is empty. In other words, when you submit an instruction to the cluster you have to wait until the task will be executed and  the result available. \n",
    "Hence, it is trivial that this execution flow is not really suitable when you have a small instructions with no huge computation necessities, cause you need to wait results that can be potentially elaborated on your computer. In the other hand this is a powerfull method when you have to execute parallel instructions or with huge resources requests in terms of CPUs and RAM."
