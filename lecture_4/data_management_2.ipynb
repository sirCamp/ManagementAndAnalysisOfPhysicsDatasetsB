    "### What is MapReduce?\n",
    "\n",
    "MapReduce is a programming model and an associated implementation for processing and generating big data sets with a parallel, distributed algorithm on a cluster. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapReduce)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A MapReduce program is composed of a map procedure (or method), which performs filtering, sorting or element elaborations (such as sorting out students by first name, one queue for each name), and a reduce method, which performs a summary operation (such as counting the number of students in each queue, yielding name frequencies). The MapReduce  frameowork it's essential when you have big data problems and a cluster.\n",
    "It's realiable and fault tolerant and allows to work on huge data (Exabyte) on a cluster without memory issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is a specialization version of the ```split-apply-combine``` approache for data analysis. Each action of the map or reduce function is made on a partition of data with an indipendet process.\n",
    "Each worker of a cluster execute the same operations on separated chunks of data. Once the computation is terminated the results are retrieved from each worker node and then they are combined toghter. If necessary the map-reduce function are applied again on the results combination. This process is repeated until all the operations are done and all the results are merge into single one which is the real final results.\n"
